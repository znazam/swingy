// if hero dies he losses mission
// if he wins he gains exp and level up if exp is full, an artifact he can keep or leave no guarantee though
// formular for leveling up level*1000+(level âˆ’ 1)2*450
// must be run as java -jar swingy.jar console, java -jar swingy.jar gui
// save data in a relational database
